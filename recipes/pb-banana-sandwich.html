        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a super quick and simple lunch that is also filling. This sandwich was my go-to while I was in college.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 slices of bread</li>
                <li>1 whole banana</li>
                <li>1 jar peanut butter</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cover both slices of bread in as much peanut butter as you like. Be sure to spread it <em>crust to crust</em>. We do not want any non-buttered patches on the slices.</li>
                <li>Unpeel and cut the banana into dimes about a quarter inch thick. Place the cut banana dimes on one of the slices of bread.</li>
                <li>Take the other slice with no banana on it and place it atop of the banana'd slice.</li>
                <li>Viola! You've done it. Now go enjoy that ooey-gooey goodness. Be sure to have a glass of water in case you need to free your mouth from getting too peanut-buttery.</li>
            </ol>
        
        <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Optionally, you can toast the slices of bread to add an extra crunch to each bite you take.</li>
                <li>For the sweet toothed among us, you can add a little honey to the combination for some extra sweetness.</li>
            </ul>
